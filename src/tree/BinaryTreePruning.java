/**
 * Given the root of a binary tree, return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a 1 has been removed.
 *
 * A subtree of a node node is node plus every node that is a descendant of node.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: root = [1,null,0,0,1]
 * Output: [1,null,0,null,1]
 * Explanation:
 * Only the red nodes satisfy the property "every subtree not containing a 1".
 * The diagram on the right represents the answer.
