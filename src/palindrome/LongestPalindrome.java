/**
 * Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest palindrome that can be built with those letters.
 *
 * Letters are case sensitive, for example, "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "abccccdd"
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation:
 * One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
