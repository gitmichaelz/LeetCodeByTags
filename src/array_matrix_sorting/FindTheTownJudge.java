/**
 * In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.
 *
 * If the town judge exists, then:
 *
 *     The town judge trusts nobody.
 *     Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
 *     There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
 *
 * You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi.
 *
 * Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
 * Output: 2
