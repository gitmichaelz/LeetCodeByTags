/**
 * Given an integer n, break it into the sum of k positive integers, where k >= 2, and maximize the product of those integers.
 *
 * Return the maximum product you can get.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 2
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: 2 = 1 + 1, 1 × 1 = 1.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 10
 * Output: 36
 * Explanation: 10 = 3 + 3 + 4, 3 × 3 × 4 = 36.

    //If an optimal product contains a factor f >= 4, then you can replace it with factors 2 and f-2 without losing optimality, as 2*(f-2) = 2f-4 >= f. So you never need a factor greater than or equal to 4, meaning you only need factors 1, 2 and 3 (and 1 is of course wasteful and you'd only use it for n=2 and n=3, where it's needed).

    //For the rest I agree, 3*3 is simply better than 2*2*2, so you'd never use 2 more than twice.
